  //From what I understand, it's up to the user to input how many ever rectangles they want to compare, then input those rectangles' lengths and widths, and be presented with data including:
  //-Each rectangle's area from smallest to largest
  //-Each rectangle's area from largest to smallest
  //-The average area of the rectangles
  //-The minimum and maximum area of the rectangles. 
  //I'm just gonna make what I assume they want me to make, and if that's wrong, then whatever.
